#+title: No actual repos will be on here, instead go to [[https://codeberg.org/amadaluzia][my Codeberg]] or [[https://copeberg.org/amadaluzia][my Copeberg]].

* What happened to amadalusia?
Amadalusia is irrecoverable because I
no longer have the 2FA stuff for it.
It's a silly mistake that happened while
installing AOSP on my Pixel. My discord,
matrix and codeberg are fine because
I remembered to recover them.

* Why no GitHub?
[[https://nogithub.codeberg.page][file:https://nogithub.codeberg.page/badge.svg]]

*  What is this page then?
This houses all my contributions to
whatever GitHub repo I like, such being
nixpkgs and wallpkgs.

* Where will you find me?
