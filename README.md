# THIS IS NOT FOR PERSONAL PROJECTS, ONLY FOR CONTRIBUTIONS {#not-personal}

I do not trust GitHub as a good place for storing my *personal*
projects, especially with GitHub Copilot's history of not respecting
copyleft licenses, and the generally shady practices displayed across
multiple articles regarding GitHub. If you want to look at my projects,
or dotfiles or if you want to contact me: please see my [website].

I will still use GitHub, as I tend to use GHA for certain tasks, as well
as I need it for collaborating with other projects anyway. This applies
with every source sharing platform I am in.
