## What happened to amadalusia?

Amadalusia is irrecoverable because I no longer have the 2FA stuff for
it. It's a silly mistake that happened while installing AOSP on my
Pixel. My discord, matrix and codeberg are fine because I remembered to
recover them.

# Why no GitHub?

[![Please do not use GitHub for personal projects.](https://nogithub.codeberg.page/badge.svg)](https://nogithub.codeberg.page)

# What is this page then?

This houses all my contributions to whatever GitHub repo I like, such
being nixpkgs and wallpkgs.
